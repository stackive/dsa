## What is a Linked List?
A **Linked List** is a data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers.
Each node contains:
- A **value**
- A **pointer** to the next node in the list

Unlike arrays (lists), the data is not stored in one block of memory.

## Big O of Common Operations

| Operation                            | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Add to the end                      | O(1)* or O(n)    | Fast if tail is tracked, else we must traverse to the end |
| Remove from the end                 | O(n)             | Need to go through all nodes to reach the one before last |
| Add to the head                     | O(1)             | Just point the new node to the old head |
| Remove from the head                | O(1)             | Just move head to the next node |
| Insert in the middle                | O(n)             | Need to find the exact position first |
| Delete from the middle              | O(n)             | Again, must find the node before it |
| Lookup by index or value            | O(n)             | No direct access like arrays |

> ðŸ’¡ *O(1) add-to-end is only true when the tail reference is maintained.*

## Linked List vs List (Array)

| Operation                | Linked List | Python List (Array) |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Access by Index         | O(n)        | O(1)                 |
| Add at End              | O(1)*       | O(1) Amortized       |
| Add at Start            | O(1)        | O(n)                 |
| Insert in Middle        | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Delete at Start         | O(1)        | O(n)                 |
| Delete at End           | O(n)        | O(1)                 |
| Delete in Middle        | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Search by Value         | O(n)        | O(n)                 |

## When to Use Linked Lists?
- You need fast insertions/deletions at the start
- You donâ€™t need fast access by index
- Youâ€™re dealing with large datasets where memory reallocation is expensive
